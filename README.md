Contributing
============

We use grunt for running tests and such, so, if you want to contribute, you'll
want to install grunt's cli `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`. Once you have done
so, you can run any of our grunt tasks: `grunt watch`, `grunt test`, `grunt build`,
`grunt release:(major or minor or patch)`
